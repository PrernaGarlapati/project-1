A Random Number Generator (RNG) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple tool that picks a random number within a range set by the user. The HTML handles the structure, including input fields for the minimum and maximum values, a button to generate the number, and a spot to display the result. CSS makes everything look nice and user-friendly. The real magic happens with JavaScript, which uses Math.random() to generate a number, adjust it to fit the chosen range, and display it on the page. When the user clicks the button, the script grabs the inputs, checks if theyâ€™re valid, generates a number, and updates the display instantly.
